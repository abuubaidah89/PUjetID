All of the files listed below need to be edited to have the proper paths.
crab_DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCUETP8M1_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8.py
JMEFlatTreeProducer.cc
EventCounter.cc
As a pre-requisite to follow my instructions below is to checkout the latest recipe for the pileupJetId 

1. first I create a flat ROOT tree using the EDAnalyzers JMEFlatTreeProducer.cc and EventCounter.cc
These modules need to be in some appropriate /plugins/ area (in my private case they were in KKousour/TopAnalysis/plugins/ 
or in CMSSW_7_6_3_patch2/src/JetMETAnalysis/pileupJetId) and need to be edited accordingly.

2. once the flat tree is created you need to run the script CreateTreeForPileupJetIdTraining.C, which creates the tree that
will be used by the training script.

3. the MVA training script is the trainPileupJetID.C

4. once you have the new MVA weight files you need to put them in RecoJets/JetProducers/data and re-run the flat tree producer
in order to store the new pileup id mva and boolean flags.

5. finally, I have some simple macros that will allow you to fill histograms and create the ROC curves.
